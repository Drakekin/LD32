LUDUM DARE 32: Five Minutes From Hell
=====================================

A work in progress entry for Ludum Dare 32, theme: *Unconventional Weapon*.

Current concept:    
You broke into Omnicorp's headquarters on the colony world of Bernard III and stole the experimental weapon prototype XN47. 
It fits in a briefcase, and came with clear instructions on how to activate it, but you don't know what it does. 
Omnicorp would quite like it back. 
The government would also like you not to have it. 
The doomsday cultists would also like to get their hands on it. 
And they are all chasing you.
There is a transport off-world waiting a safe distance away, make your way there before you're caught.
Or find the components required to fire the weapon and fight back.
Or some third option in between?
Your choice, but think fast because they're all coming to get you.
